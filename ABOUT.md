# Mission - Beyond What We're Building

NeoNurture focuses on a core problem in neonatal care: families receive information that is technically accurate but often hard to understand and difficult to follow across transitions, especially from the NICU into outpatient pediatrics. This transition often involves multiple specialists, therapies, and follow-up plans. Responsibilities shift, documentation fragments, and the overall clinical course can become hard to track, even between clinicians themselves, regardless of if the care itself is excellent.

NICU documentation is typically dense and optimized for billing, compliance, and throughput rather than longitudinal understanding. NeoNurture is exploring whether better information design, clinician-supervised language tools, and structured support systems can make this information easier to navigate for both families and clinicians.

The long-term goal is to inform a NICU-specific clinical environment that prioritizes communication and continuity, rather than inheriting general-purpose legacy EMR design.

## 🧩 NeoNurture combines two related efforts:

### 1. Documentation and Communication Support for Clinicians  
Research into how neonatal documentation can be structured and restated in clearer, more readable ways, while keeping clinicians fully responsible for all medical communication.
- See project README for more info!

### 2. Family Support and Navigation  
Development of a family-centered hub that provides:
- education and discharge navigation
- logistics support
- connections to peer-support communities
- **optional access to licensed clinical psychologists**

These support services are **delivered by humans**, the focus is clarity, grounding, and continuity; we know, through lived and personal experience, the fear and uncertainty that becomes almost second nature in the NICU. 🤍

The platform also includes guided intake tools and daily check-ins so families can share concerns and learning needs. Where permitted, the platform will link to the infant’s medical record to tailor educational resources to the baby’s condition (e.g., jaundice, feeding, respiratory support, etc.).

Educational personalization is driven by structured clinical fields and family-reported needs, **not automated clinical inference**. Clinical data is mapped to a curated educational library and presented for clinician-approved review and family use.
